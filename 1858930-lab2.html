            <p class="p1">
                I am a proud final year student atthe University of Witwatersrand, doing Bachelor of Science in 
                Computer Science. I love solving problems, wether given or self discovered. As the saying goes
                <q>
                   <i>"Technology is the science that grants an individual power to make thoughts come into reality."</i> 
                </q>

                I have done a lot of projects in my previous years at the university. Including writing scripts to automate tasks on my laptop,
                to building a fully functional android app in my second year. The programming languages I have worked with so far are:

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>

            <p>
                The latest project I have worked on was a dictionary web application where you can search the meaning of words. 
                Not only that but you can search for synonyms and antonyms of words. I used a free dictionary api online. Tech stack,
                html, css, JavaScript and Java(JSP) for backend. I ma proud of it beacuse it was a start for me learning how to develope a fullstack,
                Website.
